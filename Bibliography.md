## People's recommandations

### Neel's bibliography

- [Andreas Abel's Habilitation](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~abela/publications.html#habil)
(defunctionalized NbE)
- [Implementing a modal dependent type theory](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3341711), and its [implementation](https://github.com/jozefg/blott)
- [Semantic analysis of normalisation by evaluation for typed lambda calculus](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/article/semantic-analysis-of-normalisation-by-evaluation-for-typed-lambda-calculus/E3727362B3E059149680CC3482FFDCFC) (baby version of Jon's stuff)
- [Notes on sconing and relators](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-56992-8_21) (early usage of glueing?)
- [Type-directed partial evaluation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/237721.237784) (the og paper)

- programming exercise: program it + defunctionalize it!

### Sterling's suggestion (2018) on the HoTT book

- Andreas' habilitation, Fiore's paper
- A [very short note by Streicher](https://www2.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/snbe.pdf) with just the slogan
- [Categorical reconstruction of a reduction free normalization proof](https://www.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/mitarbeiter/martin-hofmann/pdfs/categoricalreconstruction.pdf) 1995, Altenkirch Hoffmann Streicher
- [Normalization and the Yoneda Embedding](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/52CC6B0D0961F134ABF28BF6A824D45B/S0960129597002508a.pdf/normalization-and-the-yoneda-embedding.pdf)

- Coq's stuff: [native_compute](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-25379-9_26) (explicitly sold as "untyped NbE") and [vm_compute](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/583852.581501) (older, maybe not so NbE?)
- [Canonicity and normalisation for Dependent Type Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09367), typical short but efficient Coquand paper
- [A functional correspondence between evaluators and abstract machines](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/888251.888254) equivalence between the NbE and abstract machine approaches
